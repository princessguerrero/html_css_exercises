        The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria × ananassa)[1] is a widely grown
        hybrid species of the genus Fragaria, collectively known as the strawberries. It is cultivated worldwide for its
        fruit. The fruit is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness.
        It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as preserves, juice, pies, ice creams,
        milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in many products like
        lip gloss, candy, hand sanitizers, perfume, and many others. The garden strawberry was first bred in Brittany, France,
        in the 1750s via a cross of Fragaria virginiana from eastern North America and Fragaria chiloensis, which was brought
        from Chile by Amédée-François Frézier in 1714.[2] Cultivars of Fragaria × ananassa have replaced, in commercial production,
        the woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca), which was the first strawberry species cultivated in the early 17th century.[3]
        The strawberry is not, from a botanical point of view, a berry. Technically, it is an aggregate accessory fruit,
        meaning that the fleshy part is derived not from the plant's ovaries but from the receptacle that holds the ovaries.[4]
        Each apparent "seed" (achene) on the outside of the fruit is actually one of the ovaries of the flower, with a seed
        inside it.[4]</p></div>
