            The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria × ananassa)[1] is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus Fragaria,
            collectively known as the strawberries. It is cultivated worldwide for its fruit. The fruit is widely appreciated
            for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities,
            either fresh or in such prepared foods as preserves, juice, pies, ice creams, milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial
            strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in many products like lip gloss, candy, hand sanitizers,
            perfume, and many others. The garden strawberry was first bred in Brittany, France, in the 1750s via a cross
            of Fragaria virginiana from eastern North America and Fragaria chiloensis, which was brought from Chile by Amédée-François
            Frézier in 1714.[2] Cultivars of Fragaria × ananassa have replaced, in commercial production, the woodland strawberry
            (Fragaria vesca), which was the first strawberry species cultivated in the early 17th century.[3] The strawberry
            is not, from a botanical point of view, a berry. Technically, it is an aggregate accessory fruit, meaning that
            the fleshy part is derived not from the plant's ovaries but from the receptacle that holds the ovaries.[4] Each
            apparent "seed" (achene) on the outside of the fruit is actually one of the ovaries of the flower, with a seed
            inside it.[4]</p>
