    <h1>About the Grizzly Bear</h1>
    <p>The grizzly bear is a North American subspecies of the brown bear.</p>
    <h2>Diet and Behavior</h2>
    <p>These awe-inspiring giants tend to be solitary animals—with the exception of females and their cubs—but at times they
        do congregate. Dramatic gatherings of grizzly bears can be seen at prime Alaskan fishing spots when the salmon run
        upstream for summer spawning. In this season, dozens of bears may gather to feast on the fish, craving fats that
        will sustain them through the long winter ahead. Brown bears dig dens for winter hibernation, often holing up in
        a suitable-looking hillside. Females give birth during this winter rest and their offspring are often twins. Grizzly
        bears are powerful, top-of-the-food-chain predators, yet much of their diet consists of nuts, berries, fruit, leaves,
        and roots. Bears also eat other animals, from rodents to moose. Grizzlies are typically brown, though their fur can
        appear to be white-tipped, or grizzled, lending them their traditional name. Despite their impressive size, grizzlies
        are quite fast and have been clocked at 30 miles an hour. They can be dangerous to humans, particularly if surprised
        or if humans come between a mother and her cubs.</p>
    <h2>Habitat</h2>
    <p>Grizzlies once lived in much of western North America and even roamed the Great Plains. European settlement gradually
        eliminated the bears from much of this range, and today grizzly populations in the continental U.S. are protected
        by law. Many grizzlies still roam the wilds of Canada and Alaska, where hunters pursue them as big game trophies.</p>
