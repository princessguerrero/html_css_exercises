    <h1>Dragons</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Dragons are massive, flying reptiles which can breathe fire onto their enemies and cook their food with the same
            flame. They are rumored to have a strong connection to magic, which seems to be proven true when magic begins
            to return to the world after the birth of the first three in over two hundred years. Dragons possess awesome
            and devastating power, capable of laying waste to armies and burning entire cities to ashes. Men who were able
            to tame and ride dragons as beasts of war used them to burn their enemies and forge vast empires across the continents
            of Essos and Westeros.</br>
            The last surviving dragons in the world were possessed by House Targaryen, who used them to conquer and unify the Seven Kingdoms
            of Westeros three hundred years before the War of the Five Kings. Most of the Targaryen dragons died in the Dance
            of the Dragons about a century and a half later, and after that, the only dragons the Targaryens were the size
            cats. Soon after the civil war ended, the last Targaryen dragons died, and the species was considered to be extinct
            throughout the world.</br> At the same time that the War of the Five Kings began in Westeros, Daenerys
            Targaryen was in possession of three petrified dragons eggs. They were given to her as a wedding gift, beautiful
            to look upon and valuable beyond comprehension, but otherwise useless. However, in a shocking display of old
            magic, Daenerys miraculously made the eggs hatch, and for the first time in generations, filling the skies of
            the world with the music of dragons once more.</p>

    <h2>Biology Overview</h2>
    <p>Dragons have long serpentine bodies, with proportionately long necks and tails. Their bodies have four limbs: two short
        back legs and two large wings as forelimbs, a body-plan similar to a bat. In later generations, after the dragons
        went extinct, physical descriptions of dragons became so confused in memory that artwork sometimes depicted them
        as having six limbs - two wings growing out of their backs in addition to four legs - but this is inaccurate. The
        teeth and claws of adult dragons are as long and sharp as swords.</p>
    <h3>Color Variations</h3>
    <p>The scale color of dragons is highly variable, and historical dragons ranged in color from black to silver, red, gold,
        and even blue. Some dragons were one solid color throughout, but more often, they tend to have one primary color
        for most of their body, with highlights in a secondary color along their spinal crests, horns, and wing membranes.
        Confirmed markings observed so far include: Black with red markings, Green with bronze markings, Cream with gold markings.
        In addition to the various scales hues observed between specimens, dragons also displayed eyes color variations.
        Dragons being reptiles, they had vertical slit pupils with colored irises. Drogon had red eyes while his brother,
        Viserion had green eyes.</p>
